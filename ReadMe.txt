Creation of the outline of a 2D Car

Part 1: Read the syntetagmenes.txt file, containing 29 points for the outline of a 2D car, and create new points by using cubic SPLINE("news.txt").

Part 2: Find 10 Control Points that create a Bezier line estimating the initial 2D car. 

Part 3: Study the vehicle's movement through a differential equation, calculated using the Runge-Kutta method. The sensitivity of the results was investigated based on the time step of integration.
